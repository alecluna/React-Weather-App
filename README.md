# React Weather App

Source code for a simple SPA. 

Calls a Yahoo Weather API, parses through the given JSON and renders/updates the data using React's powerful render() method + component lifecycle hooks.  

Learned to use the map() function and other ES6 features when displaying a list of data to be updated on each click event. 

## Hot to run ##
run with `npm install` and `npm start`
